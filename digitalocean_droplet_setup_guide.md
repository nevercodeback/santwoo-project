## 1. Choosing a Droplet Plan

DigitalOcean offers various Droplet plans tailored to different needs. Consider the following when choosing a plan:

*   **CPU:** How much processing power do you need? For simple websites or development environments, a shared CPU (Basic Droplets) might be sufficient. For production applications or CPU-intensive tasks, consider Dedicated CPU options.
*   **RAM:** Memory is crucial for running applications smoothly. The amount of RAM needed depends on your workload (e.g., databases, web servers with high traffic).
*   **Storage (SSD):** All Droplets come with fast SSD storage. Choose a size that accommodates your OS, applications, and data.
*   **Transfer:** This is the amount of outbound data transfer allowed per month. Inbound traffic is free.

**Recommendation for Beginners:** Start with a basic, low-cost plan. You can always resize your Droplet later if you need more resources. The "$5/mo" or "$6/mo" plans are often a good starting point for learning and small projects.

## 2. Selecting an Operating System

For this guide, we will use **Ubuntu**. DigitalOcean typically offers the latest LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Ubuntu, which are recommended for stability and extended support.

When creating your Droplet, you'll be presented with a choice of distributions. Select the latest Ubuntu LTS version available.

## 3. Setting Up SSH Keys

SSH (Secure Shell) keys provide a more secure way of logging into your server compared to using passwords. They consist of a private key (kept secret on your computer) and a public key (placed on the server).

### 3.1. Generating SSH Keys

**On Linux/macOS:**

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    *   `-t rsa`: Specifies the RSA algorithm.
    *   `-b 4096`: Specifies a key length of 4096 bits (very secure).
    *   `-C "your_email@example.com"`: A comment to help you identify the key.
3.  You'll be prompted to enter a file in which to save the key. The default (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) is usually fine. Press Enter.
4.  You'll be asked to enter a passphrase. **This is highly recommended!** A passphrase adds an extra layer of security to your private key. Make it strong and memorable.
5.  Your public key will be saved as `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and your private key as `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

**On Windows (using PuTTYgen, covered later, or Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL):**

If you have WSL, you can follow the Linux/macOS instructions above. Alternatively, PuTTY comes with a tool called PuTTYgen that can generate keys. We will cover this in the [Connecting from Windows using PuTTY](#connecting-from-windows-using-putty) section. It's often easier to generate the key pair on your local machine first.

### 3.2. Adding Your Public SSH Key to DigitalOcean

Before creating your Droplet (or during the creation process), you need to add your **public** SSH key to your DigitalOcean account.

1.  Log in to your DigitalOcean account.
2.  In the main menu, navigate to **Settings**, then click on the **Security** tab.
3.  In the "SSH Keys" section, click **Add SSH Key**.
4.  **Copy the contents of your public key file.**
    *   On Linux/macOS, you can display it with: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    *   Copy the entire output, starting with `ssh-rsa` and ending with your email comment.
5.  Paste the copied public key into the "SSH Key Content" field on DigitalOcean.
6.  Give your SSH key a recognizable **Name** (e.g., "My Laptop Key", "Workstation Key").
7.  Click **Add SSH Key**.

## 4. Creating Your Droplet

Now you're ready to create your Droplet:

1.  From your DigitalOcean dashboard, click the **Create** button and select **Droplets**.
2.  **Choose an image:**
    *   **Distribution:** Select the latest **Ubuntu LTS** version (e.g., 22.04 LTS).
3.  **Choose a plan:** Select the plan that fits your needs, as discussed in section 1.
4.  **Choose a datacenter region:** Pick a region geographically close to you or your target audience for lower latency.
5.  **Authentication:** This is a crucial step.
    *   Select **SSH Keys**.
    *   You should see the SSH key(s) you added to your account. Check the box next to the key you want to use for this Droplet.
    *   **It is highly recommended to disable password authentication.** If you only select SSH keys, password login for the root user will typically be disabled by default, which is good for security.
6.  **Select additional options (optional):**
    *   **Monitoring:** Basic monitoring is free and recommended.
    *   **User data:** For advanced configurations at launch.
7.  **Finalize and create:**
    *   Choose a **Hostname** for your Droplet (e.g., `my-ubuntu-droplet`).
    *   Add tags if you use them for organization.
    *   Click **Create Droplet**.

Your Droplet will now be provisioned, which usually takes less than a minute. Once it's ready, you'll see its IP address on your dashboard.

## 5. Connecting to Your Droplet via SSH

You'll need the Droplet's IP address and the private SSH key that corresponds to the public key you added.

### 5.1. Connecting from Linux/macOS

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Use the following command:
    ```bash
    ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_DROPLET_IP` with the actual IP address of your Droplet.
3.  If you set a passphrase for your SSH key, you'll be prompted to enter it.
4.  The first time you connect, you might see a message about the authenticity of the host. Type `yes` to continue.

You should now be logged into your Droplet as the `root` user.

### 5.2. Connecting from Windows using PuTTY

PuTTY is a popular free SSH client for Windows.

#### 5.2.1. Downloading and Installing PuTTY

1.  Go to the official PuTTY download page: [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2.  Download the PuTTY installer (e.g., `putty-64bit-X.XX-installer.msi`). You'll also need **PuTTYgen** (`puttygen.exe`) for converting keys if you generated your key in OpenSSH format.
3.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### 5.2.2. Converting Your Private Key with PuTTYgen

If you generated your SSH key using `ssh-keygen` (OpenSSH format, common on Linux/macOS/WSL), you need to convert your **private key** to PuTTY's `.ppk` (PuTTY Private Key) format.

1.  Open **PuTTYgen** (it should be installed with PuTTY).
2.  Click the **Load** button.
3.  By default, PuTTYgen looks for `.ppk` files. Change the file type filter to "All Files (*.*)".
4.  Navigate to where your private key is stored (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\.ssh\id_rsa` or wherever you saved it if you used WSL: `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\youruser\.ssh\id_rsa`). Select your **private** key (e.g., `id_rsa`, not `id_rsa.pub`).
5.  If you set a passphrase when generating the key, you'll be prompted to enter it now.
6.  Once loaded, click **Save private key**.
7.  Choose a location to save your new `.ppk` file (e.g., in a secure folder).
8.  You'll be asked if you want to save it without a passphrase. If your original key had a passphrase, it's recommended to use one here as well for the `.ppk` file.

**If you generated your key pair directly with PuTTYgen:**

1.  Open PuTTYgen.
2.  Click **Generate**. Move your mouse around the blank area to generate randomness.
3.  Once generated, you'll see the public key. Copy this and add it to DigitalOcean as described in section 3.2.
4.  Enter a **Key passphrase** and confirm it (recommended).
5.  Click **Save private key** and store the `.ppk` file securely.
6.  Click **Save public key** and store it for your records (though the main one you'll paste to DigitalOcean is directly from the PuTTYgen window).

#### 5.2.3. Configuring PuTTY for Connection

1.  Open **PuTTY**.
2.  **Session Category (default view):**
    *   **Host Name (or IP address):** Enter `root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP` (replace `YOUR_DROPLET_IP` with your Droplet's IP).
    *   **Port:** `22` (default for SSH).
    *   **Connection type:** SSH.
    *   You can save this session for later use: type a name in "Saved Sessions" (e.g., "My DO Droplet") and click **Save**.
3.  **Connection > SSH > Auth Category:**
    *   Click the **Browse...** button under "Private key file for authentication".
    *   Select the `.ppk` file you saved earlier.
4.  **(Optional but Recommended) KeepAlive:** To prevent your SSH session from disconnecting due to inactivity:
    *   Go to **Connection** category.
    *   Set "Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off)" to a value like `60`.
5.  Click **Open** to start the SSH session.
6.  If you set a passphrase for your `.ppk` file, you'll be prompted to enter it.
7.  The first time you connect, you might see a security alert about the server's host key not being cached. Click **Yes** to trust the host and cache the key.

You should now be logged into your Droplet as `root`.

## 6. Initial Server Setup (Recommended)

Logging in as `root` is powerful but risky for everyday tasks. It's highly recommended to perform an initial server setup, which includes:

*   Creating a new non-root user with `sudo` privileges.
*   Configuring SSH to use this new user.
*   Disabling root login via SSH (if not already disabled by default with key-only auth).
*   Setting up a basic firewall (e.g., UFW).

DigitalOcean has excellent tutorials on initial server setup for Ubuntu. Search for "Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu [your version]" on their community site.
